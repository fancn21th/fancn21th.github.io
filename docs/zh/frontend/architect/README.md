## What is architecture

I can not agree more about how [Lukas Ruebbelke]() explain what is frontend architecture is all about in his lesson @ [Transform Local JavaScript Functions into Serverless API Endpoints](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-decoupling-has-driven-frontend-architecture).

::: tip

"We can not effectively discuss any design pattern without first discussing coupling, abstraction, and cohesion."

-- [Lukas Ruebbelke]()

I think when it comes to the architecture of a newly coming frontend project, big or small. It always comes down to the decision what should be gathered around and what else should be separated into different layers.

Single Responsibility always prevail and works alone.
All you need to do is simply put one task into single small file and wire them up in a elegant style.

Somehow it remind me of the architecture of the nature world. We never invent it and just see it through from the true world and mimic at large.

::: tip

"Good abstraction not only simply thins conceptually but create incredible opportunities that are not immediately obvious."
